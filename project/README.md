## Project Guidelines

### Purpose

The project component of this course allows students to:
- Apply concepts from labs and assignments to real-world problems
- Demonstrate integrated knowledge of web services and data analysis
- Build portfolio-worthy work samples
- Practice professional software development practices

### Project Types

Select one of the following project types or propose an alternative with instructor approval:

#### 1. **Web Application & API Integration**
- Build a web application that consumes one or more REST APIs
- Examples: Weather dashboard, cryptocurrency tracker, social media analyzer
- Technologies: Python/Flask, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, API requests

#### 2. **Data Analysis & Visualization Project**
- Analyze a public dataset and create insights
- Examples: Stock market analysis, social trends, sports statistics
- Technologies: Python, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, Jupyter

#### 3. **Machine Learning Application**
- Build a predictive model and deploy as a web service
- Examples: Classification, regression, clustering projects
- Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, Flask API

#### 4. **Custom Hybrid Project**
- Combine web services, data analysis, and/or machine learning
- Propose your own topic with approval
