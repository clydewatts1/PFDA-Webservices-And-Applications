# PFDA Webservices And Applications ✅

**Short description**

A small repository containing lab materials for web services and applications. This repo currently includes a tiny demo HTML file and a PDF with environment setup instructions.

---

## Contents 🔧

- `labs/hello.html` — simple HTML page that prints "hello" to the page and logs `Hello World!!` to the browser console.
- `Lab01 set up environment.pdf` — environment setup instructions for Lab 01 (open to view details).

---

## Quick start 🚀

1. Open `labs/hello.html` in any modern web browser (double-click the file or drag it into the browser window).
2. The page displays **hello** in the page body.
3. Open the browser console (DevTools → Console) to see the message: `Hello World!!`.

---

## Prerequisites ✅

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)

---

## Tutorials & Exercises 🔍

- HTML Tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp (see the "Try It Yourself" examples)
- JavaScript Tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp (see the "Try It Yourself" examples)

Try these steps locally:
1. Follow the W3Schools HTML and JavaScript tutorials and open the "Try It Yourself" examples.
2. Edit `labs/hello.html` to add JavaScript inside `<script></script>` tags.
3. Open `labs/hello.html` directly in your web browser.
4. Open Developer Tools → Console to see the output (e.g., `hello World`).

> Note: We are opening the files directly from the filesystem (not from a web server). The browser will still run HTML and JavaScript, but some features (e.g., fetch, modules) may require a server.

## Notes & Next steps 💡

- Add more labs or expand the existing examples to cover common webservice tasks (API calls, JSON handling, etc.).
- Consider adding a project license and contribution guidelines if this will be a collaborative repo.
